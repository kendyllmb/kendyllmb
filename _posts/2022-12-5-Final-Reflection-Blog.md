## My DH Journey

In the beginning of this course, I did not fully grasp and understand the extent of the Digital Humanities field. One of our readings early on in the class was [this site](https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/) created by Jason Heppler. It is a compilation of quotes that define what digital humanities are from different perspectives and sources. I think this reading set us up well for providing an overall definition of DH. After the first few weeks of class, I was able to gain more knowledge and appreciation for the Digital Humanities world. 

Staring off, I really liked having our [syllabus](https://deanna-stover.github.io/coursesCNU/2022/engl350fall2022) on the github site. It was a fresh and new way of presenting information for the class and I enjoy having everything in one place. I also think it set us up well for using github in our blogs and seeing how the site can be utilized. Github was a new and somewhat tedious site to learn. I really benefited from having the walkthrough instructions and video on the syllabus. I was able to refer back to it when needed and it definitely helped set me up for success.

As I __reflect__ on the course readings, I was more engaged in readings that involved technology and an interactive delivery of information. I am a visual learner and the readings that had that added piece were the ones that connected me to the DH field more. For example, the reading [*"What Makes Writing More Readable"*](https://pudding.cool/2022/02/plain/) was an interactive and informative site that really stood out to me. On the other hand, the readings that were more complex and lengthy did not contribute to my understanding of DH as much as the interactive ones.

One assignment that I __struggled__ with was the [Review Blog 1](https://kendyllmb.github.io/kendyllmb/2022/10/21/Review-Blog-1.html). We were tasked with choosing a DH project from a list provided and fully analyze the project in its entirety. I struggled with this assignment as some of the historical importance was hard for me to understand since I am not a history major and lack that passion. I liked being able to explore the DH project but it was a bit difficult identifying important information needed to completed the assignment to the best of my abilities. I think I would have benefited more from a group discussion in class and overall analysis of the project. 

On the other hand, there were a number of assignments that helped me __grow__ as a writer and digital humanist. One of my favorites was the [Review Blog 2](https://kendyllmb.github.io/kendyllmb/2022/10/21/Review-Blog-2.html). I was able to dig deeper into a Digital Humanities Project that was related to the final assignment in the class, the grant proposal. [*Living Together / Living Apart*](https://www.livingtogetherlivingapart.com/) is a Digital Humanities project created by [Dr. John Finn](https://cnu.edu/people/johnfinn/), an Associate Professor of Geography at Christopher Newport University. This project addresses racial segregation in the local Hampton Roads community and very similar to the vision I had for my DH project.

The grant proposal was something I was not familiar with before this class. I have learned a lot about grant writing and the process it takes to create a DH project idea. After completing this lengthy process, I wish I could carry through with my grant project as I have been passionate about the topic and its importance. 

This class has provided me with a lot of new perspectives, knowledge, and skills to put in my academic toolbox. I have __grown exponentially__ as a writer by being more confident in my writing, and have emerged as a __digital humanities student__.
