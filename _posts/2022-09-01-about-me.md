## Life Before CNU

I am from Stafford, Virginia only 2 hours away from campus (3 on a bad day with I-95 traffic). 

In my free time, which I dont have a lot of in college, I enjoy watching netflix, playing volleyball, shopping, and hanging out with friends.


## Life at CNU

I am a senior here at Christopher Newport University. I am majoring in Business Management with minors in Biology and Leadership Studies. I am also part of the [President's Leadership Program](https://cnu.edu/academics/plp/) and the [Biotechnology and Management Program](https://cnu.edu/academics/biotech/) here at CNU.

Throughout my years here at CNU, I have been involved in many extracurricular activities. As a senior, I have found my place in a few involvements that are important to me.

* ### Delta Gamma - Social Sorority

I ran home to Delta Gamma my 2nd semester sophomore year. Coming back from the pandemic and my freshman year being cut short, I needed to find my place on campus. Joining DG was the best decision I could've made for myself and I have found my best friends and taken on a leadership position as vp: programming. In this position, I planned our chapterâ€™s yearly sorority retreat and this one being the first in person retreat since 2018 which I had never experienced before. Thinking back to the high school version of me, NEVER did I think I would be in a sorority, let alone in a leadership position. College has truly allowed me to grow into the person I am today while gaining so many valuable skills.

 * ### Alpha Phi Omega - Co-ed Service Fraternity

I also joined Alpha Phi Omega my 2nd semester sophomore year. Covid made it difficult to find service opportunities so I decided to join this service fraternity and find a structured way of completing community service. I have had the opportunity to get over 40 hours of community service with APO in just 3 semesters. From unloading trucks of girl scout cookies to making dog toys for the SPCA, I have taken part in really rewarding service opportunities. I have also taken on a leadership role in APO as our Logistics Chair which is responsible for scheduling rooms at CNU for our events.

 * ### Front Desk Assistant - Tutoring Center

Since sophomore year, I have worked as an FDA in the Tutoring Center. This part time job has taught me how to manage my time and also given me opportunities for professional growth in the workplace. I'm lucky to have a job on campus where I can grow as a student and gain experience working in different environments and using my management and leadership skills.


## Life Beyond CNU


After I graduate in May, I hope to find a job related to healthcare management or sports management. With a management degree and biology and leadership minors, I feel like I have a well-rounded education with the ability to work in many different fields.
