## Summary: ## 

*Living Together / Living Apart* is a Digital Humanities project created by Dr. John Finn, an Associate Professor of Geography at Christopher Newport University. This project addresses racial segregation in the local Hampton Roads community. There are two research questions presented in this project

1. “What can we learn about the experiences of living in racially segregated cities using oral history interviews and “photovoice” with a diverse group of people?”
2. “How can oral histories, photography, audio, and digital mapping be used to engage the community in meaningful, open ways to challenge the “naturalness” of segregated landscaped and explore alternative futures?”

There are many parts to this project that includes personal interviews, photographs of the area, and interactive maps. This information includes research conducted to analyze the socio-environmental impacts of redlining and segregation in the Hampton Roads area in the 21st century and educate readers on these issues.
