## Summary: ## 

*Living Together / Living Apart* is a Digital Humanities project created by Dr. John Finn, an Associate Professor of Geography at Christopher Newport University. This project addresses racial segregation in the local Hampton Roads community. There are two research questions presented in this project

1. “What can we learn about the experiences of living in racially segregated cities using oral history interviews and “photovoice” with a diverse group of people?”
2. “How can oral histories, photography, audio, and digital mapping be used to engage the community in meaningful, open ways to challenge the “naturalness” of segregated landscaped and explore alternative futures?”

There are many parts to this project that includes personal interviews, photographs of the area, and interactive maps. This information includes research conducted to analyze the socio-environmental impacts of redlining, which is the discrimiation of a race or ethnicity in a variety of ways due to where they live, and segregation in the Hampton Roads area in the 21st century. The main goal of this DH project is to educate readers and raise awareness of these issues that are still prevalent today.

## Humanities Application: ##

This DH project relates directly to the history of racial segregation and redlining. There is a lot of research and visuals to help the reader understand the connection to the historical importance of recognizing this issue in the Hampton Roads community. By relaying this information to the audience in forms of maps, photographs, and interviews, they are able to connect on a deeper level. There is a lot of information that this site provides in order to educate others on the socio-environmental impacts of redlining and segregation in Hampton Roads.

Under the “Mapping Segregation” tab, there is an interactive portion of the site that allows the reader to deep dive into how the site uses information and portrays it on the site. It walks the reader through how to connect the map information to the research done by the team. The 5 sections of information are Segregation Mapped, Redlining, Projects & Burbs, Segregation Forever, and Segregated Virginia.

## Technology: ##

The technology used in this DH project is very impressive. I appreciate the thoroughness of how the information is presented and the interactiveness for the reader. 

The map at the end of the “Mapping Segregation” tab called “Segregated Virginia” is the overall, interactive map on this site since it has the ability to overlap data.
