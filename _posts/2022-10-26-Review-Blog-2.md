## Summary: ## 

*Living Together / Living Apart* is a Digital Humanities project created by Dr. John Finn, an Associate Professor of Geography at Christopher Newport University. This project addresses racial segregation in the local Hampton Roads community. There are two research questions presented in this project

1. “What can we learn about the experiences of living in racially segregated cities using oral history interviews and “photovoice” with a diverse group of people?”
2. “How can oral histories, photography, audio, and digital mapping be used to engage the community in meaningful, open ways to challenge the “naturalness” of segregated landscaped and explore alternative futures?”

There are many parts to this project that includes personal interviews, photographs of the area, and interactive maps. This information includes research conducted to analyze the socio-environmental impacts of redlining, which is the discrimiation of a race or ethnicity in a variety of ways due to where they live, and segregation in the Hampton Roads area in the 21st century. The main goal of this DH project is to educate readers and raise awareness of these issues that are still prevalent today.

## Humanities Application: ##

This DH project relates directly to the history of racial segregation and redlining. There is a lot of research and visuals to help the reader understand the connection to the historical importance of recognizing this issue in the Hampton Roads community. By relaying this information to the audience in forms of maps, photographs, and interviews, they are able to connect on a deeper level. There is a lot of information that this site provides in order to educate others on the socio-environmental impacts of redlining and segregation in Hampton Roads.

Under the “Mapping Segregation” tab, there is an interactive portion of the site that allows the reader to deep dive into how the site uses information and portrays it on the site. It walks the reader through how to connect the map information to the research done by the team. The 5 sections of information are Segregation Mapped, Redlining, Projects & Burbs, Segregation Forever, and Segregated Virginia.

## Technology: ##

The technology used in this DH project is very impressive. I appreciate the thoroughness of how the information is presented and the interactiveness for the reader. 

The map at the end of the “Mapping Segregation” tab called “Segregated Virginia” is the overall, interactive map on this site since it has the ability to overlap data. This is my favorite part of this project because of how user-friendly and interesting it is. The ability to filter through and show/unshow various overlays helps connect common themes. The main map includes a variety of information including:

* Public Housing Developments
* Redlined Neighborhoods
* Household Income
* Home Value
* Predominant Racial/Ethnic Group

There is a second map on this site, “Mapping the Socio-Environmental Impacts of Racial Segregation” shown below, goes more in depth about the following areas: 
1. Redlining Hampton Roads
2. Race
3. Poverty
4. Environmental Justice
5. Tree Canopy and Urban Heat
6. Impervious Surfaces and Urban Heat 

Since this section contains more historical information and research behind the above topics, there is a greater understanding of the effects of racial segregation which is the point of this section of the project. Overall, it brings together research and the application of that data on the map and helps the readers get the full picture of the impacts of the research on the larger community.

"Photovoice" is another part of this project as shown below. The researchers gave out disposable cameras to individuals in the community and asked them to take pictures of places that had an impact on their life. Each photo was then put into an interactive map based on location with comments from the community about why this location/building was meaningful to them.The map has larger bubbles to visually represent the number of photos taken in that area by the community.  This part of the project really brings together the community to see how the areas they live in impact their views on life.

## Improvements: ##

This DH project has a lot of moving parts, literally and figuratively. I really love the way the site is set up and how the information is presented to the reader. 

Since this project has a somewhat complex map with a variety of information included, sometimes it may be daunting for the reader to fully understand. On the other hand, the thoroughness of this topic is very helpful and may just take some time to comprehend what is being shown.

My initial issue with this project was in relation to the main map shown below. At first, I thought it wasn't working. After more interaction with the page I realized that there was a small button at the bottom corner of the map, called “Explore” that allows you to turn on and off the ability to interact with the map. I would suggest making this button more visible to users by either changing the placement or making it larger.

Another issue I noticed had to do with the “Mapping Segregation” page. There seems to be a typo where the roman numerals go from IV (4) to VI (6) as shown in the images below.
