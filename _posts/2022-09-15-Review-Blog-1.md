## Summary: ## 

Charles Booth’s London is the record and application of the working class between the years 1886 and 1903 in the United Kingdom. Charles Booth funded and organized one of the most informative and scientific surveys of London’s social life with details about poverty, the working industry, religion, and police investigations. This research is named the Inquiry. Due to the size and complexity of this research project, it paved the way for new methods and techniques for social research.


## Project Application: ##

This DH project gives the reader a better understanding of the social and economic history of London in the late 19th century. By interacting with the map information, and reading the articles and notebooks, the reader can apply how the poverty and working conditions of the London community are related. There is a section labeled “Highlights'' that addresses a few common themes that were addressed in the police notebooks. These highlights include Drink and Drugs, Migrant Communities, and Prositution. This allows the reader to dive deeper into these topics that were prevalent in London during the surveys. This direct comparison between the community in present day London and from the late 19th century has a large historical use in analyzing how things have shifted over the years. This is an important matter to the community of London and researchers looking into more information about the social and economic status of this area.


## Technology: ##

![Map of London with slider](https://kendyllmb.github.io/kendyllmb/images/map.jpeg)

Charles Booth used a complex method of analyzing the lives of people in the community by interviewing them at their workplace, home, and places of worship. They used the comments from interviewees to generate statistical evidence of the working conditions in London. This data was then used to make a map of the London poverty levels divided by streets and location. This was one of Charles Booth’s most well-known achievements. 

This map is interactive, giving the reader the ability to use the slider to move between Booth’s map and the present day map. This shows a direct overlay of both maps at once allowing a nearly perfect comparison of streets/location. This is relevant because it connects to present day map data which is easier for the reader to relate to and analyze in present day conditions. 

Another technological part of the site is the scanned notebooks from interviews and data. Readers are able to display the notebooks from a specific area of the map and search based on keywords or location. This connects the data to a visual representation of the location where these notes were taken.


## Improvements: ##

![George H. Duckworth's Notebook](https://kendyllmb.github.io/kendyllmb/images/notebook.jpeg)

This DH project has a lot of information and moving parts. The notebooks seem to provide less information to the general public and reader since they are not experts on the field. An explanation of the content of the notebooks would really benefit the reader to make it easier to understand the numbers and brief wording. While the scans of these original notebooks are great quality making it easy to read, it may still be hard for some to transcribe it themselves. There are brief summaries next to some of the pages but there is no direct transcription, which I think would be beneficial to the reader.

![Box with the word "Maps" on it](https://kendyllmb.github.io/kendyllmb/images/maps.jpeg) 

Another improvement I would suggest is in relation to the map. The author labels the singular map area on the main home page as “Maps” (plural). This seems a bit confusing since it is actually 1 interactive map overlay with the ability to slide between present day and Booth’s map. They also use the language, “Browse and search the maps”. The use of the plural language, in my opinion, gives the reader the sense that there are multiple maps to analyze when in fact it is a singular map area of London.
 
![Legend showing socioeconomic status](https://kendyllmb.github.io/kendyllmb/images/legend.jpeg) 

Another interactive improvement I suggest is about the legend on the map. I would have liked to see the legend have the ability to click and filter the color/poverty level. I think this would give the reader the ability to visually see the poverty levels based on location. 


## Summary: ##

Overall, I think this Digital Humanities project gives some great information to the reader. With a few slight tweaks it would be more accessible to the audience it is reaching. I learned a lot of new information from this site as there were a number of resources scattered throughout the DH project.
