## Summary: ## 

Charles Booth’s London is the record and application of the working class between the years 1886 and 1903 in the United Kingdom. Charles Booth funded and organized one of the most informative and scientific surveys of London’s social life with details about poverty, the working industry, religion, and police investigations. This research is named the Inquiry. Due to the size and complexity of this research project, it paved the way for new methods and techniques for social research.

## Project Application: ##

This DH project gives the reader a better understanding of the social and economic history of London in the late 10th century. By interacting with the map information, and reading the articles and notebooks, the reader can apply how the poverty and working conditions of the London community are related. There is a section labeled “Highlights” that addresses a few common themes that were addressed in the police notebooks. These highlights include Drink and Drugs, Migrant Communities, and Prositution. This allows the reader to dive deeper into this topics that were prevalent in London during the surveys.


## Technology: ##

Charles Booth used a complex method of analyzing the lives of people in the community by interviewing them at their workplace, home, and places of worship. They used the comments from interviewees to generate statistical evidence of the working conditions in London. This data was then used to make a map of the London poverty levels divided by streets and location. This was one of Charles Booth’s most well-known achievements. This map is interactive, giving the reader the ability to use the slider to move between Booth’s map and the present day map. Readers are also able to display the notebooks from that area and search based on key words or location.

## Improvements: ##

This DH project has a lot of information and moving parts. The notebooks seem to provide less information to the general public and reader. While the scans of these original notebooks are great quality making it easy to read, it may still be hard for some to transcribe it themselves. There are brief summaries next to some of the pages but there is no direct transcription, which I think would be beneficial to the reader.

Another improvement I would suggest is in relation to the map. The author labels the map as “Maps” and uses the language, “Browse and search the maps”. This seems a bit confusing since it is actually 1 interactive map with the ability to change between present day and Booth’s map. 

I also would have liked to see the legend have the ability to click and filter the color/poverty level. I think this would give the reader the ability to visually see the poverty levels based on location.
